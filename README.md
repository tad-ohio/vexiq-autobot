# vexiq-autobot
# Description
1. My first pass at an autonomous robot.
2. Written in the RobotC IDE using a C like language.
3. Uses the Distance, Bumper, and Gyro sensors.
4. Currently configured to run for 1 minute or if the battery level drops below approximately 30%.
5. It follows a back-and-forth drive pattern across the floor. The direction of this pattern can be altered based on the obsticles in the bots path.
6. At the end of the run the bot does a final dance then the program exists.

# Future Changes
1. I would like to turn this into a claw-bot that can identify and pick up objects and place those objects in a pre-determined place.

# Change History
